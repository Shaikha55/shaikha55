### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Shaikha Alzaabi.
Iâ€™ve graduated from Zayed University with BSc in Information Technology Concentration in Security and Networking Technologies.

I started loving programming when I consistently started to code. That feeling you get when you get your desired output with minimal code after a long grind and hard work. I love coding because it really excites me, it is fun to do. It really excites me whenever I come across a problem, I get curious about solving it. I am a person who loves to solve puzzles, questions involving logic and thinking ability.
